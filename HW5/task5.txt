1. a is incremented by 1 and then alerted; b is alerted and then incremented by 1
   a and b are already 2; a is firstly incremented by 1, then we add 2; we add 2 to b and then b is incremented by 1
   a and b are already 3 and then they're incremented

2. The answer is x = 5. 
   a *= 2 means the same as a = a * 2;
   a * 2 = 4, then we add 1
